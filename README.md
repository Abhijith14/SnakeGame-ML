## üìï Installation

### üï∑Ô∏è Create an environment
Whatever you prefer (e.g. `conda` or `venv`)
```console
mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

### üï∑Ô∏è Activate it
Windows:
```console
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Mac / Linux:
```console
. venv/bin/activate
```
### üï∑Ô∏è Install PyTorch and dependencies

For Installation of PyTorch see [official website](https://pytorch.org/).

You also need `PyGame`, `Matplotlib`, `IPython`:
 ```console
pip install pygame, matplotlib, ipython
 ```

If you get an error for numpy, install numpy separately:
 ```console
pip install numpy
```



## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage
Run
```console
python agent.py
```
This will start training the agent. It takes upto 80 - 100 gameplays for the model to be trained good. <br>
If you want to change the number of gameplays, edit this section in function get_action, class Agent in [agent.py](agent.py):
```console
def get_action(self, state):
    self.epsilon = {{ Enter your number of gameplays for training }} - self.n_games
```
You can find the [model file](model/model.pth) inside model folder.<br>
Also while training, you can find the training graph with the number of gameplays vs Scores

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customize
Have a look at [game.py](game.py). You can change the game variables according to your own use case. <br>
Change the colours of the game elements over here.
```
# rgb colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
RED = (200,0,0)
BLUE1 = (0, 0, 255)
BLUE2 = (0, 100, 255)
BLACK = (0,0,0)
```
Default BLOCK_SIZE (Size of a block in the game) and SPEED (speed of snake) is set to 20.
```
BLOCK_SIZE = 20
SPEED = 20
```
In the init function of class SnakeGame; the parameters w and h are the width and height of your game window.
```
def __init__(self, w=640, h=480):
        self.w = w
        self.h = h
```
